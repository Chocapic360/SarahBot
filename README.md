# SarahBot
Using AI to reply with "That's what she said!" to discord messages when appropriate.

# AI Model
Currently using Meta-LLama-3-70b-instruct profile from Replicate AI.
I'm using this model because it worked the best with the prompt I gave it.

# AI PROMPT
'Do you think the joke response 'That's what she said!' would be a comedic response to the message: {message_content}. your answer should be one word YES or NO. A response of that's what she said is usually funny when the message relates to size, girth, depth, hardness, wetness, or tightness of an object.'
'You are a funny assistant that only replies with YES or NO and gives no context as to why you chose your answer'

This prompt works ok, but it's definitely not perfect. I would love someone to improve on it but then again this project is pretty silly so IDRC.

# NOTE TO EMPLOYERS
If you are somehow an employer looking at this repository please advert your eyes. This is a silly and quite frankly stupid project.
I have other much more interesting and useful projects on my github. I am only hosting this repo publicly so that other discord servers can implement this bot and so I feel like I wasted less time making this.
